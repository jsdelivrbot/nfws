Contrib-Other Modules

Field Limiter
-from drupal.org SANDBOX module 
-relies on contrib module field_formatter
Field_Limiter allows to limit the number of items to display in MULTI-VALUE IMAGE FIELDS.  
This allows to limit to 1 IMAGE displayed in a Content Type's TEASER so VIEWS can use 
'SHOW: CONTENT' instead of 'SHOW: FIELDS'."
